# Federated Learning for Smart Cities

In this project we forecast short-term residential energy consumption using "SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data" provided by London Datastore. Using this dataset our aim is to showcase advantages of Federated Learning against centralized alternatives. For this purpose, we set up two Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting purposes. The stacked LSTM model consists of four layers while simple LSTM model has only one layer.
